                    <p>Welcome to Shutter Thoughts, a personal blog where I share my journey. I believe that photography is not about having the best camera or equipment. It is about what the picture means to you and seeing the world with fresh eyes and capturing moments that speak to you.</p>

                    <p>I initially started with Instagram to share my photos but over time, I grew tired of how mechanical it all felt, people posting because they had to, not because they wanted to, the AI edited images, bots, and the algorithm. No judgment towards anyone it just wasnâ€™t for me.</p>
                        
                    <p>I miss the days when people built their own little corners of the internet, personal websites and blogs made out of passion, when the web felt more like an ocean rather than a strip mall around the corner. Iâ€™m a programmer by trade based in Davis, CA (Go Ags!) and starting this blog is my way of reviving that old school spirit. Creating something personal, genuine.</p>
                    
                    <p>On this blog, you'll find my growing collection of photographs, blog posts about my experiences and some rants about the changing world. </p>
